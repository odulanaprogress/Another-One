## 🚨 Common Launch Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

### Pitfall #1: Over-Engineering
**Problem:** Building too many features before launch  
**Solution:** Launch with core features only (search, book, escrow). Add more based on user feedback.

### Pitfall #2: Not Enough Properties
**Problem:** Great platform, no inventory  
**Solution:** Have 50+ properties in at least 3 cities before full launch.

### Pitfall #3: Poor Customer Support
**Problem:** Slow responses kill trust  
**Solution:** Commit to <2 hour response time first 3 months. Consider chatbot for FAQs.

### Pitfall #4: Ignoring Unit Economics
**Problem:** Spending too much to acquire each customer  
**Solution:** Track CAC vs LTV weekly. If CAC > 30% of first booking value, optimize.

### Pitfall #5: Weak Vetting Process
**Problem:** One bad listing ruins reputation  
**Solution:** Never compromise on vetting. Better to have fewer listings than bad ones.

> 
> With AGENT:
> ✅ Found her perfect community in South Austin
> ✅ Watched 4K walkthrough & 3D tour
